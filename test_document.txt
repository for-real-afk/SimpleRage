    This is a test document to verify the RAG system is working correctly.
    
    Key Information:
    - The system uses Pinecone for vector storage
    - Gemini is used for embeddings and answer generation
    - The application is optimized for Render's free tier
    
    Technical Details:
    - Maximum file size: 2MB
    - Chunk size: 500 characters
    - Embedding model: text-embedding-004
    - LLM model: gemini-2.0-flash-exp
    
    This document should be split into multiple chunks and stored in the vector database.
    When queried, the system should be able to retrieve relevant information and generate
    accurate answers based on this content.
